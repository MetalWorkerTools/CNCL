# CNCL
[CNCL](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9P42TB5T697H), a Teach-In application, gives a CNC controlled conventional lathe the ability to perform CNC tasks without CNC programming or the need for a CAD or CAM program. [CNCL](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9P42TB5T697H) makes it easy to precisely turn a radius or a taper, grind drills and mills, broach a gear, knurl (cut) a shaft, do any pitch (high precision) threading or rigid tapping, turn a spur gear or pulley cutter, mill a helix gear, simply by setting a few parameters. No complex calculations needed, all you need are the dimensions of the part to turn. The built-in tool change and tool library let you select a tool and continue without the need for adjusting positions. Change from Metric to Inches by a click on a button. Backlash compensation is implemented, no need to fit ball screws. For repetitive tasks, a record and play-back function is available. The recorded GCodes can be saved for use on other types of controllers. A manual is built-in and can be printed.  
[CNCL](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9P42TB5T697H) is optimized to run on a small 7" touch screen (tablet). The supported controllers are GRBL, grblHAL, Grbl_ESP32, or compatibles, free open source controllers based on affordable (Arduino) hardware. Check the hardware compatibility list for more information. The controller can be connected by USB, Bluetooth or a (Wi-Fi) network.  
If you ever wanted to start with CNC, this is the easy and affordable way to do it.
[CNCL](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9P42TB5T697H) is also provided as a 30 days trial version. The trial version is a full version without limitations. Check the License Information task for more information.  
[CNCL](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9P42TB5T697H) is available from the Microsoft Store.
