# CNCL
[CNCL](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9P42TB5T697H), a Teach-In application, gives a CNC controlled conventional lathe the ability to perform CNC tasks without CNC programming or the need for a CAD or CAM program. [CNCL](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9P42TB5T697H) makes it easy to precisely turn a radius or a taper, grind drills and mills, broach a gear, knurl (cut) a shaft, do any pitch (high precision) threading, turn a spur gear or pulley cutter, simply by setting a few parameters. No complex calculations needed, all you need are the dimensions of the part to turn. The built-in tool change and tool library let you select a tool and continue without the need for adjusting positions. Change from Metric to Inches by a click on a button. Backlash compensation is implemented, no need to fit ball screws. For repetitive tasks, a record and play-back function is available. The recorded GCodes can be saved for use on other types of controllers. A manual is built-in and can be printed.  
[CNCL](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9P42TB5T697H) is optimized to run on a small 7" touch screen (tablet). The supported controllers are GRBL, grblHAL, Grbl_ESP32, or compatibles, free open source controllers based on affordable (Arduino) hardware. Check the hardware compatibility list for more information. The controller can be connected by USB, Bluetooth or a (Wi-Fi) network.  
If you ever wanted to start with CNC, this is the easy and affordable way to do it.
[CNCL](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9P42TB5T697H) is also provided as a 30 days trial version. The trial version is a full version without limitations. Check the License Information task for more information.  
[CNCL](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9P42TB5T697H) is available from the Microsoft Store.

##  Version 2.3.71 is released on 06-2021:
### New in this version:
* I can’t get a new version released by Microsoft that has a trial option **and** usage license options. To avoid wasting any more time I have decided to drop the one year and permanent usage licenses. All current and new owners of an app license can use the app without limitations.
* Added an Engraving task for engraving dials
Mono space font, orientation left to right or Clockwise, limited characters 0123456789.,-+/ \"°Ø iI| ┤├
For this task there is an instruction video. Select the Engraving task, press the help button and press the video icon. This will take you to the video.
* Added a Form tool type for use in the GearCutter and TBelCutter turning task
* Added a Tool selection option for the Grinding task.
* Added a repeat option for the Grinding task when there is only one flute to grind.
* Added Start X and Home X positions to the Grinding task.
* Added an instruction video for the knurling task
* Changed the line spacing calculation in the Knurling task to make the spacing independent of the knurling Angle.
* Changed the rotation in the Knurling task to CCW to see the knurled lines better.
* Changed the check for using a preferred tool for that task. An unpreferred tool has to be approved at every tool change for the selected task.
* Disabled disconnecting when the app is suspended to avoid position loss when the app is used on a tablet.
* Fixed TNRC for Chamfer inner turning not working any more.
